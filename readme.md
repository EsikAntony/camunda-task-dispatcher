# Camunda External Task Dispatcher
Camunda External Task Dispatcher is a kind of middleware that helps to execute [external service tasks](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/user-guide/process-engine/external-tasks/) of [Camunda PBM](https://camunda.org/) at your Java code placed in your app.
## Getting started
When you decide to use [Camunda PBM](https://camunda.org/) as orchestrator of your system based on microservices, then you should write some boilerplate code to communicate with Camunda REST API to execute external service tasks. In each microservice in each project. Fortunatelly we did this work for you in this project.
